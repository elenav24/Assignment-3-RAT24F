This function takes in two ints and uses a while loop to figure out
how far apart these numbers are, without doing math to calculate it
 *]
integer lower, upper, temp;
get(lower, upper);
if (lower > upper)
{
    temp = upper;
    upper = lower;
    lower = temp;
}
fi
temp = 0;
while (lower < upper) {
    lower = lower + 1;
    temp = temp + 1;
}
put(temp);
